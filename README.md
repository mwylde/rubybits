# RubyBits

RubyBits is a library that makes dealing with binary formats easier. In
particular, it provides the Structure class, which allows for easy parsing
and creation of binary strings according to specific formats. More usage
information can be found in the docs (generated by `rake yard`) or by looking
at the specs.
